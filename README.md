# Game-of-Life

This is a python programm to simulate the Game of Life, developed by the mathematician John Conway.
It uses a tkinter GUI where you can play the game and try different configurartions.
This version of the Game has periodic boundary conditions, i.e. when you leave the field at one side you will return at the other side.
The rules of the Game of Life are:
  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
